# Description
Graphical demonstrations of various sorting algorithms are instructive, as they provide 
insight into how an algorithm behaves. The program demonstrates different sorting algorithms by sort the vertical lines by lengths. The program will record the the time taken to run each sorting algorithm and output to the GUI.
