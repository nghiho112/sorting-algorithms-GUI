# Description
Graphical demonstrations of various sorting algorithms are instructive, as they provide 
insight into how an algorithm behaves. The program demonstrates different sorting algorithms by sort the vertical lines by lengths. The program will record the the time taken to run each sorting algorithm and output to the GUI.

# Sorting algorithms implemented
- [x] Bubble sort
- [x] Selection sort
- [x] Insertion sort
- [x] Shell sort
- [x] Merge sort (Interative)
- [x] Merge sort (Recursive)
- [x] Quick sort (Recursive)

# Instruction

Run the program on Intellij IDEA CE, a GUI window will pop up demonstrates different sorting algorithms and the time it took to sort the lines. First click `Scramble Lines` to scramble line, click different sorting algorithm to see it work, and click `Reset` to make the lines scrambled again.

The GUI demonstration should look like this:
